# terriblytinytales-Assignment
This project is done with respect to the assignment provided by Terribly Tiny Tales for the campus placement.

In this project I have used following libraries:-
1. Bootstrap - for styling and making the webpage responsive
2. recharts - for making histogram
3. axios - for fetching data from api
